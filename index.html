            Greetings earthlings! Welcome to my page! My name is MacKenzie but most people call me Kenzie, Kenz or Mac. I am a true daydreamer at heart, some of the things I daydream about are: rescuing kittens, traveling the world, aliens, flying off in the Tardis with the Doctor, cheese curds, creating a sick nasty website for my jewelry business and achieving the perfect winged eye liner. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I graduated from The University of Kansas with a Bachelor of Science in Journalism with an emphasis on strategic communication. I missed the Jayhawks winning the NCAA national championship by one year but I never missed a basketball game all four years. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Two years ago I moved to Colorado to take a position as a sales representative for Milwaukee Tool, while living there I discovered my passion for silversmithing. I have been creating silver jewelry for about two years now and I absolutely love it. After completing the Coding Bootcamp I hope to create a website for my jewelry business which is called Bad Wolf Metals. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I have to wonderful/awful kitties that I love more than anything! Someday I hope to have cats, dogs, hedgehogs and goats. Thank you for reading a little bit about me!
